# COP2805C Module 8 Programming Assignment

Design and implement a JavaFX program which converts U.S. dollars to Canadian dollars, European euros, and British pounds as shown in the figure included below. You can use Google for the current exchange rates. The user enters the U.S. dollar amount and the conversion rates and clicks the Convert button to display the converted amount. (Hint: For the euro conversion, use the Italy locale so the currency symbol is positioned before the calculated currency value instead of after).
